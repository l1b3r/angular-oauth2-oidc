# Change Log

## Lates features

See [Release Notes](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/releases) for details on each release.

## Older versions

Since Angular 5, versions of this library matched up with the Angular version.
So versions 5.x were released while Angular 5 was out, the 6.x versions during Angular 6, etc.
If you need to support a specific old version of Angular, you can consider using a version of the library that lines up.

For older release notes check the repository version history, or above-linked release notes.
For even older versions, check out [the old change log](https://github.com/manfredsteyer/angular-oauth2-oidc/blob/5d676101c6118d6fa01bfa05b17fb4a58490eaf7/CHANGELOG.md).
